             	<h1>The History of Hawiwi</h1>
	    	<h2>1.0: Brief history of Bob</h2>
             	<p>Bob is the founder of Hawiwi, so first we will talk about his life. First, Bob started as a baby. His life really sucked and he didn't like it. He wanted to do something for the world so that nobody would ever have to live how he lived again. So later in his life he got a portal that took much land from Hawaii and brought it intot the sky. Hawaii was no longer the biggest country in the world and was now part of the United States. Now that he did that, he built a time machine and made it to where when he was born, he was taught, now Bob could do more. Later, the original Bob died, but the new Bob has taken over Hawiwi and was now filling it with unicorns. Now Hawiwi is the Land of the Unicorns! </p>
		<h3>1.1: The beginning of Bob's life</h3>
		<p>Many people are unaware of Bob in general, but the people that are aware of him do not know that he started out as a baby. He was born in a ditch by a volcano that was in the middle of erupting while meteors were falling next to them. The night that he was born was a terrible night, and when he was born he learned about the terrible things in this world. From that point on, he knew how to take care of all of the horrible things in his life. He was determined to destroy Hawaii, the source of evil. At the time, Hawaii was the biggest country in the world, being 1.5 times bigger than the Russia. It was the United States, Brazil, and Russia.</p>
		<p>Even though Bob was 38 minutes old, he knew that Hawaii had to be destroyed. He knew he couldn't do anything about it at his age, so when he was older, he knew that he would have to make a time machine when he was older. He had to do that so he could go back in time and team himself. (Bob wasn't affected by the way movies and stuff make time bad to go and touch yourself, so he could go back in time without a worry). Finishing soon!</p>
